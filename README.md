# Telegram-Bot-Template
Stacking templates for my future TeleBot projects

The first time I found that HTML exists, I was also having deep interest in making multi-purpose telegram bot
due to using many bots myself. Now, when I decided to dedicate my academic mind to become an Engineer, I think saving plain 
template for certain type of bot would be useful as the process of finishing the whole shape my bot with Telegram API faster,
since I would spend less time writing codes that would be visible to the users.

Feel free to take them for yourself, and bear with me....
